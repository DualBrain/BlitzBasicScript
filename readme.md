# BlitzBasicScript
BlitzBasicScript is a simple yet powerful scripting language based on the BlitzBasic syntax. The primary intention of BBScript is to create games which can be played in any modern web browser â€“ from unspectacular skill games to advanced 3D shooters.

**Important Note:** The Blitz Basic Script project has been re-implemented, so this project has been archived. You find the new version here: https://github.com/SparkFountain/blitz-basic-script-full-stack/
